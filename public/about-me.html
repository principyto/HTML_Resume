<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Daniel Cerda Cortes, i graduated from SAE Mexico in 2022 and i have a degree in Game Programming, although i use unity as my main
  wotk tool, ive been exploring unreal engine as another option to do games with teams that doesnt necesarely know how to program.</p>

<p>i have quite a bit of diferent hobbies and interests, inclouding web development, boxing, riding motorbikes, gaming, brewing and gardening,
  i also have a small youtube channel where i post about my projects and experiences as a game developer and sometimes a little blog about my other interests.
</p>

<p>After a long discovering trip to australia i came back to my hometown to pursue the dream of living of being a programmer and thats why i started
  Angela's full stack course in udemy, so i can have more opportunities in the field aside from game developing.</p>
